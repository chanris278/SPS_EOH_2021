    <p>
        Why do people and things float in space instead of falling back down to the ground? 
        If you’re like most people, you probably guessed its because there’s no gravity in space. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, let’s do some science with this idea and see whether it works or not. 
        The hypothesis is that if you go high above the ground and throw a ball gently, it’ll float away because there’s no gravity way up in space. 
        Lucky for you, we’ve prepared a little simulation of exactly this that you can use below, using the real laws of physics. 
        This simulation is Newton’s Cannon, showing Isaac Newton’s idea that if you put a cannon on top of a mountain so tall it was in space, you could launch a ball without air resistance into orbit. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Go ahead and drag the slider to 100m/s (100 meters per second, where a meter is about three feet). 
        That’s the speed our cannon will fire the ball at. 
        Do you think it will enter orbit? Give it a shot and find out.
    </p>

        <p> Total energy for a 100kg object= <span id="energy"></span>J</p> 
    </div>

  	<p> All energy values are for a 100kg mass, which would be a small 
	satellite or a 220lb human. This is much less than a NASA astronaut 
	on a space walk—an empty suit is 280lb (127kg)! Total energy should 
	be constant and equal to the value below the speed slider, but you 
	can see it change a little due to the limitations of this type of 
	iterative simulation.</p>
  
    <p>
        That was boring. Why don’t you increase the speed to 2000m/s? That’s right, two kilometers per second. We’re going to throw the ball sideways so fast it could travel more than a mile in a second. What do you think this will look like? Give it a shot and see how far the ball flies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Still not very far at all! To be sure, it flew hundreds of kilometers across Earth’s surface, but that wasn’t quite enough for it to stay in space. Try 5000m/s, 6000m/s, and 7200m/s and see what happens. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Something striking happens when you fire it fast enough – once it’s halfway around the planet, if you fired it at 7200m/s, it starts going away from the planet instead of toward it, and it comes right back to its original point! There’s no new force pulling it away from the planet, the ball is just flying sideways so fast that gravity can’t keep it near the surface – it moves sideways faster than gravity can keep it curving down toward Earth. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The lesson we’ve learned from all of this is that there’s a whole lot of gravity in space! Things don’t just float around in space because there’s no gravity, they stay up because they’re all travelling at the right velocity to be continuously falling sideways so fast that they simply miss the ground every time they go around and get slingshotted back around again.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Newton discovered gravity and how the planets orbited, he had to invent calculus to make the math work. That’s a bit complicated, but if you want to understand the physics and the math we used to write this simulation without knowing calculus, follow these links, we have another demonstration of how to do the math to simulate a whole orbit using just a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12QNcK0xbNNFOpYuDyHMDQOP2fNBxKZ2xV0G1TCx4lAU/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a> and some <a href=
        "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KgRQTEy2gpb6UjCPhg92p5Oze7BKbSTu/view?usp=sharing">algebra</a>.
    </p>

    <p>This simulation is based on Isaac Newton&rsquo;s famous thought
    experiment and illustration of firing a projectile from a high
    mountaintop at various speeds, as he described in
    <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DXE9AAAAcAAJ">A 
    Treatise of the System of the World</a>.
    This simulation was based off of the tutorial by Prof. Daniel V. Schroeder, a fantastic tutorial to learn HTML5 and javascript. If you're interested in learning the basics of making websites, head to <a href="http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/">his website</a>!
